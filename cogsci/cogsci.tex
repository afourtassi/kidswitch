\begin{abstract}
Children tend to produce words earlier when they are connected to a
variety of other words along both the phonological and semantic
dimensions. Though this connectivity effect has been extensively
documented, little is known about the underlying developmental
mechanism. One view suggests that learning is primarily driven by a
network growth model where highly connected words in the child's early
lexicon attract similar words. Another view suggests that learning is
driven by highly connected words in the external learning environment
instead of highly connected words in the early internal lexicon. The
present study tests both scenarios systematically in both the
phonological and semantic domains, and across 8 languages. We show that
external connectivity in the learning environment drives growth in both
the semantic and the phonological networks, and that this pattern is
consistent cross-linguistically. The findings suggest a word learning
mechanism where children harness their statistical learning abilities to
(indirectly) detect and learn highly connected words in the learning
environment.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Over the first year of life, children become sensitive to the phonetic
variations that are used to distinguish meanings in their native
language (Werker and Tees, 1984). One could imagine that these
perceptual skills would be automatically applied to the task of word
learning. However, developmental data show that 14 m.o children find it
challenging to associate minimally different (but perceptually
discriminated) sounds such as ``bin'' and ``din'' to different objects
(Stager \& Werker, 1997).

Several factors can explain this pattern of results. For example it is
possible that the task of meaning learning increases cognitive demands
on children (compared to a simple perceptual descrimination). In
particular, it requires paying attention to both the sounds and the
corresponding objects, which may hinder precise encoding in memory of
some phonetic details (Stager a\& Werker, 1997). Additional difficulty
might arise from ambiguous phonological boundaries at this stage of
development (e.g., Rost \& McMurray, 2009), or from uncertainty about
the referential status of the novel word (Fennell \& Waxman, 2009).

Regardless of the exact explanation, it is generally accepted that by
around 17 m.o, chidlren succeed under the same circumstances (Werker et
al. 2002). What could be the mechanism of development? Swingley
contrasted a binary-discontinuous scenario to a probabilstic-continuous
one. On the discontinuous account, younger children learn a single,
underspecified representation of similar words (e.g., ``bin''/``din'').
Development occurs when children specify this intial coarse
reprepsentation and learn two distinct catgories. On the continuous
account, distinct represetations are successfully learned from the
start, but these representations are encoded with higher uncertainty in
youger children, leading to apparent failure in relatively demanding
tasks.

Experimental evidence suggest a probabilsitic-continuous, rather than a
stage-like develomental scenario. On the one hand, 14-month-olds who
typically fail in the original task succeed when learning is probed
using a testing method with lower memory demands (Yoshida et al. 1009),
and when uncertainty in the emerging representations is mitigated using
disambiguating contextual cues (Thiessen, 2007; Dautriche et al., 2016).
On the other hand, adults show patterns of learning similar to those
shown by 14-month-olds when the task is more challenging and when
similarity between words increases (Pajak et al., 2016; White et al.,
2013).

Following this experimental studies, the purpose of the current work is
to propose a precise probabilsitc model of the Stager and Werker's task,
and to explore the extent to which such a model could provide a unified
accounts for several documented (as well as new) patterns of learning
and development. We first present the model and explain how it can be
used to make precise predictions of the target behavioral responses.
Second, using new data collected from both preschool children and
adults, we show how the probabilistic strucure of the model can explain
behavioral patterns both within the same age and across development.

\section{Model}\label{model}

\subsection{Task}\label{task}

We model a variant of the task used in Yoshida et al. 2009. In this
task, particiants are first exposed to the association between pairs of
nonesense words (e.g., ``lif''/``neem'') and pairs of objects. After
this exposure phase, participants perform a series of two-alternative
forced choices. In each testing trial, one of the two sounds is uttered
(e.g., ``lif'') and participants choose the corresponding object from
the two alternatives.

\subsection{Probabilistic strcuture}\label{probabilistic-strcuture}

Our model consists of a set of variables describing the general process
of spoken word recognition in a referential situation. These variables
are related in a way that refelects the simple generative scenario
represented graphically in Figure XX. When a speaker utters a sound in
the presence of an object, the observer assumes that the object \(o\)
activated the concept \(C\) in the speaker's mind. The concept prompted
the cooresponding label \(L\). Finally, the label was physically
instantiated by the sound \(s\).

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{figure}[H]

{\centering \includegraphics{figs/model-1} 

}

\caption{\label{fig:model}Graphical representation of our model. Circles indicate random variables (shading indicates observed variables). The squares indicates fixed model parameters.}\label{fig:model}
\end{figure}
\end{CodeChunk}

Because of the noisy nature of the representations, the observer can
only determine the hidden variables (i.e., the concept \(C\) and the
label \(L\)) in a probabilistic fashion. For simplicity, we assume that
the probability of membership of objects and sounds to concepts and
labels, respectivel, are normally distributed:

\[ p(o | C) \sim  \mathcal{N}(\mu_C, \sigma^2_C) \]
\[ p(s| L) \sim  \mathcal{N}(\mu_L, \sigma^2_L) \] We assume there to be
one-to-one mappings between concepts and labels, and that observers have
successfully learned these mappings during the exposure phase: \[
P(L_i|C_j) = 
\begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if  }  i=j \\  
  0  & \text{if  }  i\neq j 
\end{cases}
\] \#\# Predictions

During the testing phase (see Figure 1), participants are presented with
one target sound \(s_T \in\{s_1, s_2\}\) and two possible objects
\(o_1\) and \(o_2\). In order to make a choice, we determine which
object is more probable under the lable \(s_T\), in other words, we
compare the the probabilities \(P(o_1|s_T)\) and \(P(o_2|s_T)\). The
values of these probabilities can be computed by summing over all
possible labels:
\[P(o|s)=\sum_{C,L} P(o, C, L| s) \propto \sum_{C,L} P(o, C, L, s) \]
The joint probability \(P(o, C, L, s)\) is obtained by factoring the
bayesian network in Figure 2: \[P(o,C,L,s) = P(s|L)P(L|C)P(C|o)P(o) \]
which could be tansformed using Bayes rule into:

\[P(o,C,L,s) = P(s|L)P(L|C)P(o|C)P(C) \] Finally, assuming that the
concept prior is a uniform ditribution, we obtain the following
expression, where all conditional dependencies have been defined in the
previous secton.

\begin{equation}
P(o|s) = \frac{\sum_{C,L} P(s|L)P(o|C)P(L|C)}{\sum_{o} \sum_{C,L} P(s|L)P(o|C)P(L|C)}
\end{equation}

From the general expression (1) we were able to derive the exact
analytical expression of the probability of correct responses in the
testing phase of our simplified experimenal setting (Figure 1).

\begin{equation}
P(o_T|s_T)= \frac{1 + e^{-(\Delta s^2 + \Delta o^2) /2\sigma^2}}{1 + e^{-(\Delta s^2 + \Delta o^2) /2\sigma^2} + e^{-\Delta s^2 /2\sigma^2} + e^{-\Delta o^2 /2\sigma^2 }}
\end{equation}

We simulate the values of this probability as a function of the
perceptual distance between the sounds \(\Delta s\), using the two
remining parameters of the model: the visual distance between the
semantic referents \(\Delta o\) and the values of the standard deviation
of the dsitributions \(p(s| L)\) and \(p(o | C)\) (which, in this
simulation, have similar values, i.e.,
\(\sigma =\sigma_C \approx \sigma_L\)). The simulations are shown in
Figure 3.

\begin{figure*}[h]

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

The simulations explain previousely documented facts, and make new
predictions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  For fixed values of \(\Delta o\) and \(\sigma\), the probability of
  accurate responses increases as a function of \(\Delta s\). This
  pattern accounts for the fact that similar sounds are generally more
  challenging to learn than different sounds for both chidlren (Stager
  and Werker, 1997) and adults (Pajak et al. 2016).
\item
  For fixed values of \(\Delta s\) and \(\Delta o\), accuracy increases
  when the noise characterized with \(\sigma\) decreases. This fact may
  explain development, i.e., youger children have noisier
  representations (Swingley, 2007; Yoshida et al. 2009), which lead to
  lower word recognition accuracy, especially for similar sounding
  words.
\item
  For fixed values of \(\Delta s\) and \(\sigma\), accuracy increases
  when the visual distance between the semantic referents \(\Delta o\)
  increases. This is a new predcition that our model makes. Previous
  work studied the effect of several bottom-up and top-down properties
  in disambiguating similar sounding words (see introduction), But no
  previous study tested the effect of the visual distance between the
  semantic referents.
\end{enumerate}

To sum, we introduced a model that accounts for some qualitative
patterns observed in previous studies, and makes new predictions. In the
experiment below, we test whether the model makes accurate
\emph{quantitative} predictions by fitting it to new experimental data
collected from preschool chidlren and adults.

\section{Experiment}\label{experiment}

In this experiment, we tested participants in the word learning task
introduced above (Figure 1). We explored all three parameters of the
model. Both the sound similarity (\(\Delta s\)) and object similarity
(\(\Delta o\)) were varied simulataneousely in a within-subject design.
Besides, two age groups (preschool children and adults) were tested on
the same task to explore whether development can be characteized with
the degree of uncertainty, \(\sigma\), in the probabilsitic
representations.

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

We planned to recruit a sample of 60 children ages 4-5 years from the
Bing Nursery School on Stanford University's campus. So far, we
collected data from N=47 children (mean age= months, F=). An additional
28 children participated but were removed from analyses because they
were not above chance on the catch trials (as was specified in the
pre-registration\footnote{https://osf.io/jrh38/}). We also collected a
planed sample of N=30 adults on Amazon Mechanical Turk. N=2 adult
participants were excluded because of low scores on the catch trials
(see pre-registration).

\subsubsection{Stimuli and similarity
rating}\label{stimuli-and-similarity-rating}

The sound stimuli were generated using the MBROLA Speech Synthesizer
(Dutoit et al., 1996). We generated three kinds of sound pairs which
varied in their degree of similarity to English speakers: 1)
``different'': ``lif''/``neem'' and ``zem''/``doof'', 2)
``intermediate'': ``aka''/``ama'' and ``ada''/``aba'', and 3)
``similar'' non-English minimal pairs: ``ada''/``a\textipa{d\super h}a''
(in hindi) and ``a\textipa{Q}a''/``a\textipa{\textcrh}a'' (in arabic).

As for the objects, we used the Dynamic Stimuli javascript
library\footnote{https://github.com/erindb/stimuli} which allowed us to
generate objects in four different categories: ``tree'', ``bird'',
``bug'', and ``fish''. These categories are supposed to be naturally
occuring kinds that might be seen on an alien planet. In each category,
we generated ``different'', ``intermediate'' and ``similar'' levels of
similarity by manipuating a continuous property controling features of
the category's shape (e.g, body strech and head fatness).

In a separate survey, \(N=20\) participants recruited on Amazon
Mechanical Turk evaluated the similarity of each sound and objcet pair
on a 7-point scale. We used the average ratings across participants as
qunatitaive measures of sound pairs' distance (\(\Delta s\)) and object
pairs' distance (\(\Delta o\)).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{design}

Each age group saw only two of the three levels of similarity described
in the previous sub-section: ``different'' vs. ``intermediate'' for
preschoolers, and ``intermediate'' vs. ``similar'' for adults. The
experiment consisted of four conditions which involved, each, one pair
of sounds-objects associations. These conditions were constructed by
crossing the sound's degree of similarity with the object's degree of
similarity leading to a 2x2 factorial design in each age group. Besides
the 4 conditions, we also tested participants on a fifth catch condition
which was similar in its stucture to the other ones, but was used only
to select participant who were able to follow the instructions and show
minimal learning.

\end{figure*}
\end{CodeChunk}

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

Preschoolers were asked if they would be willing to play a game on a
tablet with the experimenter and were informed that they could stop
playing at any time. The experimenter explained that the game consisted
in learning some words spoken in an alien planet. The experiment began
with two simple examples (not included in the analysis), and in these
examples children were given feedback from the experimenter so as to
make sure they correctly understood the structure of the task. After the
introduction and examples, children were tested in a sequence of five
conditions: the four experimental conditions plus the catch condition.
In each condition, participants saw a first block of four exposure
trials followed by four testing trials, and a second block of two
exposure trials (for memory refreshment) follwoed by an additional four
testing trials.

In the exposure trials, children saw two objects associated with their
corresponding sounds. We presented the first object on the left side of
the tablet's screen simultaneously with the corresponding sound. The
second sound-object association followed on the other side of the screen
after 500ms. For both objects, visual stimuli were present for the
duration of the sound clip (∼800ms). In the testing trials, children saw
both objects simultaneousely and heard only one sound. They completed
the trial by selecting which of the two objects corresponded to the
sound. They responded by touching one of the pictures on the tablet.

The object-sound pairings were randomized across participants, as was
the order of the conditions (except for the catch condition which was
always placed in the middle of the testing sequence). We also randomized
the on-screen position (left vs.~right) of the two pictures on each
testing trial.

The procedure for preschoolers and adults were identical except that
preschoolers were accompagnied by an experimenter and used a tablet,
whereas adults used their local computers to complete the experiment
online.

\subsubsection{Model fitting}\label{model-fitting}

We fit the analystical expression (equation 2) to the participants'
responses in each age group. The values of \(\Delta s\) and \(\Delta o\)
were set based on data from the similarity judgment task (described in
the stimuli sub-section). We used two models: \textbf{model 1} fit only
one parameter (\(\sigma = \sigma_C =\sigma_L\)), and \textbf{model 2}
fit two parameters (\(\sigma_C \neq \sigma_L\)). The values of the
parameters were derived using weighted least-squares estimates.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

First we analyzed the experimental results shown in Figure (XX, left),
using a mixed-effects logistic regression with sound and object
distances as fixed effects, and with a maximal random effects strcuture
(Barr et al. 2013). Results are shown in Table XX. We found a main
effect of sound distance on the accuray of learning in both children and
adults, thus replicating previous findings. We also found a main effect
of object distance, thus confirming the new hypothesis derived from our
model.
